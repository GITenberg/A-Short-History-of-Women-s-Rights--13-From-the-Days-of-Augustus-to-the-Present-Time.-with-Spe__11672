description: Travelogues Collection offers readers a unique glimpse into the diverse
  landscape, culture and wildlife of the world from the perspective of late 19th and
  early 20th century esteemed travelers. From the exotic islands of Fiji to the lush
  jungles of Africa to the bustling streets of New York City, these picturesque backdrops
  set the scene for amusing, and at times prejudiced, anecdotes of adventure, survival
  and camaraderie. Photographs and whimsical illustrations complement the descriptive
  text, bringing to life the colorful characters encountered along the way. The Shelf2Life
  Travelogues Collection allows readers to embark on a voyage into the past to experience
  the world as it once was and meet the people who inhabited it.
